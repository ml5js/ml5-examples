			<h1>K Means Example</h1>
			<p style="width: 60%;"> K-Means is a clustering algorithm that groups <i>n</i> observations into <i>k</i> groups. It works well for well-clustered data, and is a great choice if you know the number of groups beforehand.
			Be aware that k-means solves for local optima (instead of global), so different iterations may yield different clusters. Also, because the algorithm clusters based on mean points with euclidian distance, it <i>roughly</i>expects clusters to be roughly spherical and of even sizes (see <i>Cirlces</i> and <i>Moons</i> below for examples where these expecations aren't met).
